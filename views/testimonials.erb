    <h2>User Testimonials</h2>
    "This update is the first thing I look at in the morning. The puppy gif is amazing. It just brightens my day. I look at the weather, which prepares me for the day and then I scroll down to look at all the news, which is more often than not depressing. I scroll back up to look at the puppy gif and I am happy again. I just love the website. It combines three essential things in life - news, weather, and something to make you happy. Thank you for making it an essential part of my day." – A.G.

  "Wow I just love the Daily Update!! I felt so out of touch with the zeitgeist and even slightly solipsistic until I signed up for these amazing emails! Now I actually know what’s happening in international waters in terms of current events! And the puppies are so adorable, I just drool over them! I often show them to my friends who agree that these pictures are full of fluffy fun!" – I.A.M.C.L.
